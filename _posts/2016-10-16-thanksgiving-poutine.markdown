In honor of Canadian Thanksgiving - well, belatedly, it was on the 10th - I tried my hand at [thanksgiving poutine](https://www.buzzfeed.com/christinebyrne/eli-sussman-thanksgiving-poutine) today. Traditional Canadian thanksgiving dinner is pretty much the same as the US one, but a) I wanted to do something more 'exclusively Canadian' and b) I want to cook a thanksgiving dinner for US thanksgiving as well and didn't want to do the same thing twice. So, poutine!

My last Montreal trip, I made very sure to get poutine on multiple occasions - including at La Banquise - so I have a reasonable reference point for it now.

I deviated from the recipe linked somewhat:

* I didn't pay attention to how much carrot/parsnip was specified, and just threw in everything I had, which was too much. (I also realised I don't own any kind of peeler to peel the parsnips, but improvised with my mandolin).
* I also didn't pay attention to how much chicken stock I was supposed to use... as such I think I used too much.
* I skipped heating up the smoked turkey breast slices, but mixed in some sous-vide turkey breast chunks (1.5hr @ 56C).
* I could't be bothered with making cheese curds, so I tried using paneer instead.

It didn't work out brilliantly:

* I didn't pay a lot of attention to the quantities specified in the recipe, and as such I think I used too much carrot/parsnip mix for the amount of cholla I had, and then too much chicken stock. The stuffing layer was supposed to come out crispy, and it came out mushy.
* It turns out that running my oven at 220C to roast the vegetables, and running my new induction hob at the same time to fry the cholla, causes the induction hob to overheat and shut down. One of the perils of the hob being directly above the oven I guess :)
* Because I had so much carrot and parsnip, I added the fried cholla into the roasting dish, instead of adding the carrot and parsnip into the fryig pan. This means I lost all the butter that was coating the frying pan, and that might have contributed to the stuffing starting to stick to the pan.
* The paneer doesn't really come close to cheddared cheese curds. It's similarly firm, but has no squeak, and doesn't taste as nice. Adding salt might have helped, and so might microwaving it for a little bit. I've got a lot of it left over so I'll try some experiments on it.
* I used a sachet of instant turkey gravy, and ended up making it way, way too thin. It needs to be a thick gravy, otherwise it just makes everything soggy - exacerbating the soggy-stuffing problem further.

The sous vide turkey breast was a nice addition, though. I've got quite a lot of turkey left over so I'll give it another shot when I'm back from Brighton in a few days. I think I'll substitute something else for Cholla though - it's hard to get hold of and I suspect that other egg-enriched breads would do OK instead.
