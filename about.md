Hello, I'm Richard.

I'm a Senior Software Developer at [Unity](http://www.unity3d.com) working on all kinds of things. (All views posted on this site are my own, and not those of my employer).

I've got a range of interests, from cooking and music composition, to philosophy and personal development.

I live in Oxford, UK.
